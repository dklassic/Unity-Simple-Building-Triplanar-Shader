# Unity Simple Building Triplanar Shader
 A Unity project with a one-size-fits-all triplanar building shader.
 
## Requirements
Unity 2020 LTS to open the project.
I think it might work with older versions because no fancy shader graph node is used, but not tested.

## Note
 The implementation is pretty quick and dirty so don't expect anything groundbreaking here, but if you need something that just works out of the box or just serves as a background, this shader should be pretty useful to you. Also I lack the actual knowledge to code shader, so this is generated with Shader Graph.
 You might want to remove the interior cubemap node if it doesn't fits your style though.
